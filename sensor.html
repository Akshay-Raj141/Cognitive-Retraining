        <h1>Sensory Processing Disorder</h1>
        <p>Sensory processing disorder is a condition in which the brain has trouble receiving and responding to information that comes in through the senses.</p>

        <p>Formerly referred to as sensory integration dysfunction, it is not currently recognized as a distinct medical diagnosis.</p>

        <p>Some people with sensory processing disorder are oversensitive to things in their environment. Common sounds may be painful or overwhelming. The light touch of a shirt may chafe the skin.</p>

        <h2>Symptoms of Sensory Processing Disorder</h2>
        <p>Sensory processing disorder may affect one sense, like hearing, touch, or taste. Or it may affect multiple senses. And people can be over- or under-responsive to the things they have difficulties with.</p>

        <p>Like many illnesses, the symptoms of sensory processing disorder exist on a spectrum.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>In some children, for example, the sound of a leaf blower outside the window may cause them to vomit or dive under the table. They may scream when touched. They may recoil from the textures of certain foods.</li>
            <li>But others seem unresponsive to anything around them. They may fail to respond to extreme heat or cold or even pain.</li>
            <li>Many children with sensory processing disorder start out as fussy babies who become anxious as they grow older. These kids often don't handle change well. They may frequently throw tantrums or have meltdowns.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Therapists consider a diagnosis of sensory processing disorder when the symptoms become severe enough to affect normal functioning and disrupt everyday life.</p>

        <h2>Causes of Sensory Processing Disorder</h2>
        <p>The exact cause of sensory processing problems has not been identified. But a 2006 study of twins found that hypersensitivity to light and sound may have a strong genetic component.</p>
        <p>Some people with sensory processing disorder are oversensitive to things in their environment. Common sounds may be painful or overwhelming. The light touch of a shirt may chafe the skin.</p>

        <p>Others with sensory processing disorder may:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Be uncoordinated</li>
            <li>Bump into things</li>
            <li>Be unable to tell where their limbs are in space</li>
            <li>Be hard to engage in conversation or play</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Sensory processing problems are usually identified in children but can also affect adults. They are commonly seen in developmental conditions like autism spectrum disorder.</p>

        <p>Sensory processing disorder is not recognized as a stand-alone disorder, but many experts think that should change.</p>
