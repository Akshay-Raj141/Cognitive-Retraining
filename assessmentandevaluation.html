            <h4 id="list-item-1">Brain Based Intelligence Test (BBIT)</h4>
            <p>Brain-Based Intelligence Test (BBIT) is developed in India by a team of Indian psychologists. The BBIT measures two important clusters of cognitive processes – planning & executive functions and integration of information. A crucial singular aspect of the BBIT is that it enables teachers and curriculum developers to deliver programs to enhance the cognitive processes that form the foundation of academic learning, such as reading and math. At the same time, the test assists clinicians for the diagnosis of impairment of cortical functions as in stroke, epilepsy and traumatic brain injury</p>
            <h4 id="list-item-2">Malin’s Intelligence Scale for Indian Children (MISIC)</h4>
            <p>According to Wechsler “Intelligence is the aggregate or global capacity of the individual to act purposefully, to think rationally and to deal effectively with the environment.” He developed Wechsler Bellevue Intelligence Scale in 1939.He was interested in measuring the intelligence of adults so he designed another scale known as Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS).

                The first revised edition was published in 1981- WAIS-R. Another edition was published in 1997- WAIS III. The WISC was originally developed as a downward extension of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale in 1949. WISC was broadly categorized into two parts. They are as follows:
                
                Verbal Tests – Information, Comprehension, Arithmetic, Similarity, Vocabulary & Digit Span.
                Performance Tests– Picture Completion, Picture Arrangement, Block Design, Object Assembly, Coding, Mazes</p>
            <h4 id="list-item-3">Autism spectrum disorder</h4>
            <p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurological and developmental disorder that affects how people interact with others, communicate, learn, and behave. Although autism can be diagnosed at any age, it is described as a “developmental disorder” because symptoms generally appear in the first 2 years of life.</p>
            <h4 id="list-item-4">Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder</h4>
            <p>ADHD is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders of childhood. It is usually first diagnosed in childhood and often lasts into adulthood. Children with ADHD may have trouble paying attention, controlling impulsive behaviors (may act without thinking about what the result will be), or be overly active. </p>
